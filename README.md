# 1. Introduction

With millions of players and billions of fans, football (also known as soccer in the United States) is the world’s most popular sport both to play and to watch. Due to its popularity, professional football clubs have evolved into essentially companies with shareholders and managers. Fans have become customers that help clubs generate immense revenue. From a managerial perspective, one of the most important decisions that determine a club’s chances for success is which players to employ and ensuring that they pay wages that correctly factor in the revenue the clubs will generate. 

It’s key for clubs to understand the market value of players on their team and ensure that as a club, like any company, has increased revenue, they focus on growing for shareholders and having the top talent in their club. Additionally, due to the nature of football having many variables and factors deciding a players ability on the field and value, it’s easier to localize solely on players with the role goalkeepers to control their play expectations on the field. Thus, the main question we seek to answer is:

**Research Question:** 
**In 2022, how does a goal keeper’s performance, background, and physical attributes affect their market value in football?** 

To find the answer, the standard for data on how players play, are predicted to play, and their compensation is the Fifa dataset as this closely resembles the real sport variables fairly accurately and applies variables to skills. Fifa stands for the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) and is an important body in the field of football. 

Additionally, our measurement goal is to try to measure the combination of variables that are not accounted for in the overall ranking variable in Fifa or in the value variable. These variables being Preferred Foot,Nationality, Potential, and International Reputation. With the goal of seeing to measure how these variables might correlate with a players ranking and thus their value. We seek to answer whether a player with a preferred left-foot or perhaps from a certain country, might have a higher value than another player with other variables held constant. Another end goal is to hopefully provide the outcome of the research to clubs so that they can better factor into other perhaps unconsidered characteristics into their clubs and have a better overall club performance resulting in improved football performance in the professional leagues. This could also be phrased as another question of *“How can clubs benefit from improved understanding of value and other player attributes?”*.

The dataset Fifa 2022 data is quite well poised to answer the research question and provide measurements for the goals of the research. During the dataset exploratory data analysis, it’s also expected that some variables and the way they interact may result in having an effect on player value or another skill that is unexpected yet important to note.
