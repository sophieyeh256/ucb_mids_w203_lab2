## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}


# With all values
d <- read.csv("C:/Users/tnt85/Downloads/Github Sophie/FIFA22_official_data.csv/FIFA22_official_data.csv")

#With only GK


money_formatter <- function(x) {
  x <- gsub("â‚¬", "", x)
  x <- gsub("\\.", "", x)
  x <- gsub("K", "000", x)
  x <- gsub("M", "000000", x)
  x <- as.numeric(x)
  return(x)
}

weight_formatter <- function(x) {
  x <- case_when(
    grepl("kg", x, fixed=TRUE) ~ as.numeric(gsub("kg", "", x)),
    grepl("cm", x, fixed=TRUE) ~  as.numeric(gsub("cm", "", x)),
    TRUE ~ as.numeric(x)
  )
  return(x)
}


d$Value <- money_formatter(d$Value)
d$Wage <- money_formatter(d$Wage)
d$Height <- weight_formatter(d$Height)
d$Weight <- weight_formatter(d$Weight)

df <- (filter(d, Best.Position == "GK"))

df <- subset(df, select = -Loaned.From)
df <- subset(df, select = -Marking)

```

```{r histograms for visualizing}
ggplot(d, aes(x=GKDiving)) + geom_histogram() 

# shows a heavily skewed distribution between GK normal distribution and the extremely low non-GK distribution

ggplot(df, aes(x=GKDiving)) + geom_histogram() 

# Zooming in on GK diving, shows that the distribution of GK only players is normal

ggplot(d, aes(x=Overall)) + geom_histogram()

# Other skills such as overall skill are surprisingly normally distributed among all professional players

ggplot(df, aes(x=Overall)) + geom_histogram()

# This normal distribution continues for GK players


# This implies that GK are outliers, however, it's it will be clearer to check the p-value using stargazer to see or running some tests on null hypothesis to check

# Expanding on this data diving, looking at covariates versus non-covariates is key.

#no_covariates - These are the variables which likely do not effect outcome
#with_covariates - These are the variables which likely DO effect the outcome

# Assumption: The outcome we are studying here is what is indictive of being a skilled GK, based on our research question. 
# While the dataset (d) encompasses non-GK and is extremely skewed in terms of GK skills vs typical skills.
# Thus, the GK role should be the first sorting of the data and removing the non-GK role rows

# This is reflected in the df named df

# Next is to solve the Euro and "K" mixed into the value / Wage data.
# Value & Wage are broken, need to be cleaned
# Height and weight fix (cm, Kilo)

# This is also reflected in the df named df.

# Remove Nans values? Does it skew the data, let's show a histogram before and after removal to see how it affects distribution.

# nans removed is "dff"
dff <- na.omit(df)
ggplot(dff, aes(x=Overall)) + geom_histogram()

# Removing rows with Nans results in a more well rounded dataset that more clearly shows Normal distribution


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# This atypical distribution with a right-tail for those who have the role of GK continues below.
ggplot(dff, aes(x=GKHandling)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(dff, aes(x=GKKicking)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(dff, aes(x=GKReflexes)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(dff, aes(x=GKPositioning)) + geom_histogram()
```


```{r wages, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(dff, aes(x=Value)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(dff, aes(x=Wage)) + geom_histogram()

# Wages and Contract Transfer fees are quite skewed to the left with a right tail
# This shows that the data is not iid nor meets the large sample assumptions.

```

```{r talls, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(dff, aes(x=Height)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(dff, aes(x=Weight)) + geom_histogram()

# Wages and Contract Transfer fees are quite skewed to the left with a right tail
# This shows that the data is not iid nor meets the large sample assumptions.

# mod_pooled_no_covariates <- 
# mod_pooled_with_covariates

# f_test_of_long_vs_short <- anova(mod_pooled_no_covariates, mod_pooled_with_covariates, test = 'F')
# f_test_of_long_vs_short

```

```{r talls, echo=FALSE}
# Graph all remaining X covariates
# Age, Height, Weight, Preferred Foot, Overall Ranking (# overall), nationality, potential, international reputation

ggplot(dff, aes(x=Age)) + geom_histogram()
#ggplot(dff, aes(x=Preferred.Foot)) + geom_histogram() + bins = 2
ggplot(dff, aes(x=Overall)) + geom_histogram()
#ggplot(dff, aes(x=Nationality)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(dff, aes(x=Overall)) + geom_histogram()
ggplot(dff, aes(x=International.Reputation)) + geom_histogram()

# Wages and Contract Transfer fees are quite skewed to the left with a right tail
# This shows that the data is not iid nor meets the large sample assumptions.

# mod_pooled_no_covariates <- 
# mod_pooled_with_covariates

# f_test_of_long_vs_short <- anova(mod_pooled_no_covariates, mod_pooled_with_covariates, test = 'F')
# f_test_of_long_vs_short

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
